\f0\fs28 \cf0 For our final project, we decided to implement a facial recognition system using deep learning. We built off of the Medium tutorial and GitHub by Sigurour Skuli, \'93Making your own Face Recognition System\'94. The system uses OpenCV\'92s Haas Cascade tool for bounding faces, which then get fed into a FaceNet siamese convolutional neural network. This network has been pre-trained using triplet-loss to differentiate between different people\'92s facial embeddings, so we created a database of face images tied to our names, and when the model takes in our face and creates an embedding, it checks if the L2 distance between our face\'92s output and the output of the known faces is small, meaning we are the same person.}
